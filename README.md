## Info

and is using unlicensed assets as place holders for various graphics.

## About the game
RogueDriod is a Rogue-Like game on Android (no way right!?) its presented from an isometric viewpoint and you control a character
who traverses the randomly generated dungeons. There is also a Diablo style loot system where items are generated with random names
and attributes. To accompany the loot system, a skill system is implemented that allows you to map and cast various abilities to the 
right control panel.

## Future
No updates are planned for this game in the future nor will there ever be.  This game was developed to get a feel for mobile development
and learn about different game loops.  Ideas and code snippets from this game are certain to be implemented in future endeavours however for the time
being, this project is discontinued.
